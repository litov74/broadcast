9.2 If a final judgment is entered against End User on any such IP Claim, or if in Sangoma?s reasonable opinion End User is likely to become subject to a successful IP Claim, then End User shall permit Sangoma, at Sangoma?s option and expense, either to: (a) procure for End User the right to continue using the Sangoma Software; or (b) replace or modify the same so that it becomes non-infringing, with functionality essentially being equal.
